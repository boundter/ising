\section{Conclusion}

We have looked at the Ising model and its phase transition by investigating the properties of the mean $\mean{\abs{m}}$, the susceptibility $\chi \sim \text{Var}(\abs{m})$ and the autocorrelation Corr$(t)$.\\
We have found, that big lattices of $L = 100$ approximate the analytical solutions for the phase transition quite nicely, but we have also seen, that the Metropolis algorithm is not as efficient close to $T_{crit}$ as he is far from it. This is because of the long correlation time.
