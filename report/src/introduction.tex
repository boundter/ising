\section{Introduction}

We will look at the Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm. The Ising model desciribes the magnetic properties of a solid body. The Metropolis algorithm is a special form of a Monte-Carlo simulation and helps us to reduce the needed computing time immensely. We will take an especially close look at the phase transition, where the system changes its magnetic properties from being magnetized to unmagnetized.\\
All of the used methods are described extensively in \emph{Newman, M. \& Barkema, G.; Monte Carlo Methods in Statistical Physics; Oxford University Press; 1999}
